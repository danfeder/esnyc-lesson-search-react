          # Component-specific review prompt
          direct_prompt: |
            Review this React/TypeScript code for the ESNYC Lesson Search application with special attention to:
            
            ## React Best Practices:
            - Hook usage and dependency arrays
            - Component composition (avoid prop drilling)
            - Performance optimizations (memo, useMemo, useCallback usage)
            - Accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management)
            - Error boundaries for robust error handling
            
            ## TypeScript Requirements:
            - No 'any' types - suggest proper types
            - Proper interface/type definitions
            - Generic usage where appropriate
            - Discriminated unions for complex state
            - Strict null checks
            
            ## Zustand Store Patterns:
            - State shape normalization
            - Selector performance (use shallow equality)
            - Action naming conventions (verb prefixes)
            - Avoid storing derived state
            
            ## Tailwind CSS:
            - Consistent utility class ordering
            - Responsive design patterns (mobile-first)
            - Dark mode class preparation
            - Avoid arbitrary values when possible
            
            ## Component Requirements:
            - All 16 filter categories must be supported
            - Cultural heritage hierarchy (e.g., "Asian" includes Chinese, Japanese, Korean)
            - Ingredient grouping (e.g., "Winter squash" includes butternut, pumpkin)
            - Mobile-responsive design is mandatory
            
            ## Performance Considerations:
            - List virtualization for large result sets
            - Debouncing for search inputs
            - Lazy loading for modal content
            - Image optimization
            
            Please provide specific code examples for any improvements.
            Be constructive and focus on maintainability and user experience.
