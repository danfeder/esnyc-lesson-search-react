            Consider these ESYNYC-specific categories:

            **Component Areas:**
            - filters: Related to the 11 filter system
            - search: Search functionality (Algolia/Supabase)

            - teacher-feedback: If from a teacher using the system
            
            TASK 4: Check for duplicates
            If this appears to be a duplicate:
            1. Add "duplicate" label
            2. Reference the original issue in a comment
            3. Be polite and explain the duplication
            
            TASK 5: Apply labels
            Use mcp__github__update_issue to apply appropriate labels.
            DO NOT post any comments unless it's a duplicate.
            
            IMPORTANT:
            - Only use labels that exist in the repository
            - Be thorough but don't over-label
            - For lesson submissions, check if it matches the 11 filter requirements
            - NO comments unless marking as duplicate
