# Week 1 Completion Report: Lesson Submission Pipeline

## Summary
Week 1 of the lesson submission pipeline implementation has been successfully completed. All planned tasks were accomplished, including database setup, data import, and embedding generation for semantic duplicate detection.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Schema & Migration ✅
- Created comprehensive migration with 4 new tables:
  - `lesson_submissions` - For storing new lesson submissions
  - `submission_reviews` - For tracking review process
  - `lesson_versions` - For archiving lesson versions
  - `submission_similarities` - For storing similarity calculations
- Added new columns to existing tables for content tracking
- Enabled pgvector extension for semantic search
- Applied Row Level Security policies

### 2. Data Import & Processing ✅
- Successfully imported raw text content from CSV
- Mapped 829 out of 831 lessons (99.8% coverage)
- 2 lessons missing: "Equivalent Ratios" and "Mindful Eating" (not in CSV)
- Imported confidence levels and quality markers

### 3. Content Hash Generation ✅
- Generated SHA-256 hashes for all lessons
- Identified 55 duplicate lesson sets in production
- Examples: "Herbs as Medicine", "Tamales", "Simple Machines"

### 4. Embedding Generation ✅
- Used OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model
- Successfully generated embeddings for 829 lessons (99.8% coverage)
- Total cost: ~$0.033 (very cost-effective)
- Handled extra-long lessons with aggressive truncation

### 5. Similarity Search Testing ✅
- Verified semantic similarity search is working
- Successfully identifies exact duplicates (100% similarity)
- Finds related content at various similarity thresholds
- Ready for duplicate detection in submission pipeline

## Key Statistics
- **Total Lessons**: 831
- **Lessons with Content**: 829 (99.8%)
- **Lessons with Embeddings**: 829 (99.8%)
- **Duplicate Sets Found**: 55
- **Total API Cost**: ~$0.033

## Technical Decisions Made
1. **Embedding Model**: text-embedding-3-small (1536 dimensions)
   - Best balance of performance and cost
   - $0.00002 per 1K tokens

2. **Token Handling**: Using tiktoken with cl100k_base encoding
   - Proper token counting for model limits
   - Aggressive truncation for extra-long content

3. **Duplicate Detection Strategy**: 3-layer approach
   - Content hash for exact matches
   - Title similarity for variations
   - Semantic embeddings for conceptual similarity

## Next Steps (Week 2)
1. Build duplicate detection engine
2. Create similarity scoring algorithm
3. Implement review workflow logic
4. Design API endpoints for submission pipeline
