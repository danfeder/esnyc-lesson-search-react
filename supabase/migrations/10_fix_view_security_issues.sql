-- 10. FIX VIEW SECURITY ISSUES
-- =====================================================
-- This migration fixes security issues with views that are:
-- 1. Still using SECURITY DEFINER (bypassing RLS)
-- 2. Exposing auth.users data to public/anon roles

-- =====================================================
-- 1. DROP AND RECREATE lessons_with_metadata WITHOUT SECURITY DEFINER
-- =====================================================
-- First revoke public access and drop the view
REVOKE SELECT ON lessons_with_metadata FROM anon;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS lessons_with_metadata CASCADE;

-- Recreate as a regular view (not SECURITY DEFINER)
CREATE VIEW lessons_with_metadata AS
SELECT 
  l.*,
  -- Extract metadata fields for easier querying (skip ones that exist as columns)
  l.metadata->>'activity_type' as activity_type_meta,
  l.metadata->>'location' as location_meta,
  l.metadata->>'season' as season_meta,
  l.metadata->>'timing' as timing_meta,
  l.metadata->>'group_size' as group_size,
  l.metadata->>'duration_minutes' as duration_minutes,
  l.metadata->>'prep_time_minutes' as prep_time_minutes,
  -- Array fields from metadata
  (l.metadata->>'grade_levels')::jsonb as grade_levels_array,
  (l.metadata->>'themes')::jsonb as themes_array,
  (l.metadata->>'core_competencies')::jsonb as core_competencies_array,
  (l.metadata->>'cultural_heritage')::jsonb as cultural_heritage_array,
  (l.metadata->>'academic_integration')::jsonb as academic_integration_array,
  (l.metadata->>'sel_competencies')::jsonb as sel_competencies_array,
  (l.metadata->>'observances')::jsonb as observances_array,
  (l.metadata->>'main_ingredients')::jsonb as main_ingredients_array,
  (l.metadata->>'garden_skills')::jsonb as garden_skills_array,
  (l.metadata->>'cooking_skills')::jsonb as cooking_skills_array,
  (l.metadata->>'materials')::jsonb as materials_array
FROM lessons l;

-- Grant SELECT to anon and authenticated (safe because lessons table has RLS)
GRANT SELECT ON lessons_with_metadata TO anon, authenticated;

-- =====================================================
-- 2. FIX user_profiles_with_email VIEW
-- =====================================================
-- This view exposes auth.users data which is a security risk
-- We need to either:
-- Option A: Remove it entirely if not needed
-- Option B: Create a secure function instead that only admins can call
-- Option C: Remove anon access and ensure it respects RLS

-- Going with Option C: Remove anon access and make it admin-only

-- First revoke all access
REVOKE SELECT ON user_profiles_with_email FROM anon;
REVOKE SELECT ON user_profiles_with_email FROM authenticated;

-- Drop and recreate the view
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS user_profiles_with_email CASCADE;

-- Drop the function if it already exists (from a previous migration)
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS get_user_profiles_with_email();

-- Instead of a view that exposes auth.users, create a FUNCTION that admins can call
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_profiles_with_email()
RETURNS TABLE (
  id UUID,
  user_id UUID,

-- 3. VERIFY NO SECURITY DEFINER VIEWS REMAIN
-- =====================================================
-- Create a function to check for any remaining SECURITY DEFINER views
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_security_definer_views()
RETURNS TABLE (
  view_name TEXT,
  view_owner TEXT,
