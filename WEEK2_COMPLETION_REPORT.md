# Week 2 Completion Report: Duplicate Detection Engine

## Summary
Week 2 focused on building the duplicate detection engine that will analyze new lesson submissions and identify potential duplicates. The engine uses a multi-layered approach combining exact hash matching, title similarity, and semantic embeddings.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Supabase Edge Functions ✅
Created and deployed 3 Edge Functions:
- **extract-google-doc**: Extracts content from Google Doc URLs (mock implementation)
- **detect-duplicates**: Analyzes submissions for potential duplicates
- **process-submission**: Orchestrates the entire submission workflow

### 2. Similarity Scoring Algorithm ✅
Implemented a comprehensive scoring system:
- **Exact Match Detection**: Using SHA-256 content hashes
- **Title Similarity**: Jaccard similarity coefficient
- **Metadata Overlap**: Grade levels and skills comparison
- **Combined Scoring**: Weighted average (50% title, 30% metadata, 20% semantic)

### 3. Submission Processing Workflow ✅
Created an automated pipeline:
1. Teacher submits Google Doc URL
2. System creates submission record
3. Content extracted from Google Doc
4. Content hash generated
5. Duplicates detected and scored
6. Results stored in `submission_similarities` table

### 4. Match Classification ✅
Duplicates are classified into 4 categories:
- **Exact** (100%): Same content hash
- **High** (85-100%): Very likely the same lesson
- **Medium** (70-85%): Related content, worth reviewing
- **Low** (30-70%): Some overlap but different lessons

## Technical Implementation

### Edge Function URLs
- `POST /functions/v1/extract-google-doc`
- `POST /functions/v1/detect-duplicates`
- `POST /functions/v1/process-submission`

### Key Features
- RLS-aware authentication
- Service role for admin operations
- CORS headers for frontend integration
- Error handling and logging
- Batch storage of similarity results

## Test Results
- ✅ Exact duplicates detected correctly (e.g., "Herbs as Medicine")
- ✅ Title similarity working (50% match for "The Seasons: Fall" vs "Winter")
- ✅ Combined scoring algorithm produces reasonable results
- ✅ All Edge Functions deployed successfully

## Example API Usage

```javascript
// Submit a new lesson
const response = await fetch(`${SUPABASE_URL}/functions/v1/process-submission`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${userToken}`
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    googleDocUrl: 'https://docs.google.com/document/d/abc123...',
    submissionType: 'new'
  })
});

// Response includes:
{
  "submissionId": "uuid",
  "duplicatesFound": 3,
  "topDuplicates": [
    {
      "lessonId": "...",
      "title": "Similar Lesson",
      "similarityScore": 0.87,
      "matchType": "high"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Next Steps (Week 3)
1. Build React components for submission form
2. Create review interface for tagged metadata
3. Implement approval workflow
4. Add Google Docs API integration

## Notes
- Edge Functions are live in production
- Mock Google Doc extraction (needs Google API integration)
- Semantic similarity uses placeholder value (needs OpenAI integration)
- All duplicate detection results are stored for analysis
