# Deferred-Work Campaign — Master Status

> The single cross-wave tracker the roadmap calls for (`2026-06-20-deferred-work-roadmap.md` §Scaffolding weight: "One master campaign status doc tracks all themes"). One row per wave/theme. Per-initiative execution docs only for scaffolded themes; this file points down at them.

> **Roadmap (source of truth for scope):** `docs/plans/2026-06-20-deferred-work-roadmap.md` — 169 canonical items across 7 waves, stable `C##` ids.

**Last updated:** 2026-06-21 (Wave 2 kickoff).

## Wave status

| Wave | Theme | State | Branch / PRs | Next action | Initiative doc |
|------|-------|-------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| **1** | Public "broken windows" UX (Theme B) | ✅ **SHIPPED 2026-06-21** | #522 `19d99b7` · #523 `530b253` · #524 `3c592b1` · #525 `5197069` · #526 `9eb1b6e` | — (closed) | `2026-06-20-theme-b-public-ux-*` (CLOSED) |
| **2** | Email + Security P1 | 🟢 **ACTIVE** (kickoff 2026-06-21) | `fix/wave2-c137-user-delete-crash` (PR1) | Execute PR1 (C137) in a fresh session — paste the Wave-2 doc §0 kickoff | `2026-06-21-wave2-email-security-execution.md` |
| **3** | Repo/docs hygiene (mechanical) | ⚪ queued | — | lightweight single sessions; `C60` archive + closure banners, `C169` Dependabot triage | (no scaffold — single PRs) |
| **4** | Data / corpus cleanup (DB-careful) | ⚪ queued | — | pre-delete FK checklist; `C11`/`C12`/`C08`/`C01`/`C02`/`C09` | TBD |
| **5** | Reviewer/admin features | ⚪ queued | — | **ReviewDetail decomposition first (test-first)** then `C107`/`C111`/`C112`/`C113`… | TBD (full scaffold) |
| **6** | Search depth + larger features | ⚪ queued | — | `C42`/`C41`/`C162`/`C121`/`C122` (L tier) | TBD |
| **7** | Tech-debt / simplification | ⚪ queued | — | opportunistic filler between gates; `C61`/`C100`/`C153`… | (no scaffold) |
| **F4/F5** | Process tooling | ⚪ queued | — | slot after W1, before W5; `C37` then `C38` | `reference_working_efficiency_deferred.md` |

## Standing gates (every wave that touches DB / edge functions)

- **Migration PR** → TEST-DB MCP verify (`mcp__supabase-test__`) before merge; PROD MCP verify after apply (CI's own verify step flakes — MCP is source of truth).
- **Edge-function PR** → 3-signal post-deploy verify (version + `ezbr_sha256` vs TEST + source grep). The `complete-review` matrix-push silent-no-op recurred 2×; never trust the CLI "Deployed" line. See `reference_ci_flakes.md`.
- **PROD migration approval** is a manual GitHub Environment gate (`migrate-production.yml`).
- **Additive RPC param the frontend sends** → SPLIT the PR (migration-only first, then frontend) to avoid the PGRST202 outage window. See `reference_ci_flakes.md`.
- **No refactor without page-level tests first** (esp. ReviewDetail, Wave 5).
- **Per-PR ritual:** GATE 1A/1B plan review · pre-push code-reviewer + Codex GATE 3 · four-surface bot triage + GATE 4 (Codex 2nd opinion) · per-round TEST-DB re-verify. Canonical detail in the auto-loaded `feedback_*` memories.

## Pointers

- Roadmap: `docs/plans/2026-06-20-deferred-work-roadmap.md`
- CI/deploy flake playbook: `reference_ci_flakes.md` (read before any PROD migration / edge deploy)
- 3-pipeline mental model: `reference_database_pipeline.md`
- Data-mutation hazards: `reference_data_mutation_gotchas.md` (read before any `DELETE FROM lessons` / facetCounts / concepts work)
