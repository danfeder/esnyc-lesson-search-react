# Phase 8b Execution Status

**Last updated:** 2026-04-28 03:50 UTC by Session 1
**Current PR:** PR 1 — Schema (single FK migration) — **SHIPPED (merged + PROD-applied + verified)**
**Current task:** PR 1 done. Next session starts PR 2 — Submitter flow + LessonSearchPicker + reviewer-side safety banner. First task: 2.1 (TDD `titlesAreSimilar` utility).
**Branch:** main (synced with origin/main via rebase post-merge; 1 commit ahead locally with session-1 doc updates not yet pushed)
**Last commit on branch:** `9a6b09e` on origin/main; `2e52507` is the local session-1 doc-update commit

## Done

- ✅ **Task 1.1** — created `supabase/migrations/20260504000000_phase_8b_fk_on_delete_set_null.sql`
  - Local apply via `supabase db reset`
  - Local FK confirmed via MCP: `confdeltype = 'n'`, def shows `ON DELETE SET NULL`
  - `npm run test:rls` baseline-clean (2 pre-existing `archive_duplicate_lesson` failures confirmed pre-existing on `main`)
- ✅ **Task 1.2** — pushed branch + opened PR #468
  - Pre-push code-reviewer agent dispatch: 0 critical, 1 doc nit rejected
  - `npm run type-check && npm run lint` clean
- ✅ **Bot triage on PR #468** — 3 findings from `claude-review`, all 3 rejected with documented rationale (BEGIN/COMMIT wrapper rejected as post-push edit hazard + Supabase auto-wraps; NOT VALID lock pattern rejected as low-traffic non-issue and bot itself flagged non-blocking; docs-drift advice rejected as already covered by ritual)
- ✅ **TEST DB verification** via `mcp__supabase-test__execute_sql`: `confdeltype = 'n'`, `ON DELETE SET NULL` confirmed on TEST
- ✅ **PR #468 merged** via rebase as `9a6b09e` (preserves the 9 doc-commit history alongside the migration)
- ✅ **PROD apply** — first attempt failed with documented SASL Apply-step flake (run `25032406625`); rerun via `gh run rerun --failed` succeeded after second approval. PROD verified via `mcp__supabase-remote__execute_sql`: `confdeltype = 'n'`, def shows `ON DELETE SET NULL`.

## In flight

- (none — PR 1 fully shipped end-to-end)

## Blocked

(none — user approval gate is expected, not a blocker)

## Decisions made during execution

- **Per-PR ritual corrected mid-session.** Original kickoff phrased step 1 as "Pre-push self-review: read every line of `git diff main...HEAD`" — implying I do the read myself. User clarified: pre-push review = agent dispatch (the agent does the line-by-line read; you cannot impartially review your own work). User further clarified: the second `feature-dev:code-reviewer` dispatch I'd added between push and external bots is redundant — external bots ARE the second pass; my role post-bot is investigation/triage with accept/reject recommendations, optionally spawning a subagent for deeper verification. Updated kickoff prompt + implementation plan accordingly.
- **PR comment surfaces — must check ALL of them.** I missed the `claude-review` substantive review on PR #468 by querying only `gh api .../pulls/468/comments` (line-attached comments, returned `[]`). User pushed back: "did you read the bot's comment?" The bot's full report was an issue-comment surfaced via `gh pr view --comments`. New feedback memory created: `feedback_pr_comment_surfaces.md`. Kickoff + impl plan updated with the four-surface checklist (issue-comments, review summaries, line-comments, CI/check failures).
- **TEST DB re-verification is per-round, not one-time.** User FYI: any post-PR round that produces DB-affecting fix-up commits requires re-running the TEST DB MCP verification after CI re-applies the migration. New feedback memory: `feedback_per_round_test_db_verification.md`. Kickoff + impl plan rituals extended with this step.
- **Pre-push agent finding rejected** (rollback-block sub-comment) — chrome below the user-visible-bug-or-DB-safety bar.
- **Wasted second-agent dispatch on PR #468** before bots: cost ~90s. Wrong finding (date-prefix "further than necessary") rejected. No code changes from it. Future PRs follow corrected ritual.
- **PR #468 merge strategy = rebase, not squash.** Repo convention is squash-merge, but PR carried 9 valuable doc commits from prior sessions plus the migration; rebase preserved each commit's individual message rather than collapsing the doc-iteration history into a single squash.
- **PROD apply hit the SASL Apply-step flake on first attempt.** Run `25032406625` failed with `failed SASL auth (invalid SCRAM server-final-message)` at the "Connecting to remote database..." step (the Apply step's second pooler handshake within ~2s of "Initialising login role..."). Verified PROD was unchanged via MCP (`confdeltype = 'a'` pre-rerun); confirmed clean failure with no partial state. `gh run rerun --failed` succeeded on second approval. Memory entry updated to capture the Apply-step variant of the flake (was previously documented only for Verify-step) and the rerun mitigation pattern.

## Session log

### Session 1 — 2026-04-28 03:09 UTC start, 03:50 UTC end — PR 1 shipped end-to-end

Major events:
- Read kickoff prompt, design doc end-to-end, implementation plan through Task 2.2.
- Branched `feat/phase-8b-fk-on-delete-set-null` off local `main` (which had 9 unpushed Phase 8b doc commits from prior sessions).
- Wrote single FK migration; verified locally via MCP; ran `npm run test:rls` (2 pre-existing failures, no new ones); committed as `13565e0`.
- Pre-push code-reviewer agent dispatch returned 0 critical, 1 doc nit (rejected).
- Pushed branch; opened PR #468 with PR body disclosing the 9 doc commits riding along.
- User correction: pre-push review should be agent dispatch (not me); fixed kickoff + impl plan.
- User correction: second post-PR-open agent dispatch is redundant — external bots ARE the second pass; investigation/triage is my job. Re-fixed kickoff + impl plan.
- User correction: missed `claude-review` issue-comment by querying wrong API endpoint. Created `feedback_pr_comment_surfaces.md`; updated kickoff + impl plan with four-surface checklist.
- Triaged 3 `claude-review` findings (BEGIN/COMMIT wrapper, NOT VALID pattern, docs-drift advice); rejected all with documented rationale.
- Verified TEST DB: `confdeltype = 'n'`, `ON DELETE SET NULL` correct.
- User instruction: merge PR + idle while user approves PROD. Merged via rebase (preserves doc-commit history) as `9a6b09e`.
- User FYI: re-verify TEST DB each round that produces DB-affecting fix-ups, not just once. Created `feedback_per_round_test_db_verification.md`; updated kickoff + impl plan rituals.
- PROD apply attempt 1 failed with SASL flake (run `25032406625`); diagnosed as the Apply-step variant of the documented pattern; recommended + queued `gh run rerun --failed`; updated MEMORY.md SASL entry to cover Apply-step variant.
- PROD apply attempt 2 succeeded after re-approval. Verified via `mcp__supabase-remote__execute_sql`: `confdeltype = 'n'`, def `ON DELETE SET NULL`. PR 1 fully shipped.

### Next session picks up at

PR 1 done end-to-end. Move to **PR 2 — Submitter flow + LessonSearchPicker + reviewer-side safety banner**. First task: 2.1 (TDD `titlesAreSimilar` utility, ~20 lines + 10 test cases). Branch: `feat/phase-8b-intent-first-submitter-flow`. Pre-flight reads listed in implementation plan PR 2 section.
