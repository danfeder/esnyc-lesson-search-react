# Theme B — Public "Broken-Windows" UX Execution Status

**Last updated:** 2026-06-20 by Session 6 (PR3/W1b: Task 3.1 migration + Task 3.2 frontend both BUILT + verified + pre-push-gated. **PR3 SPLIT into PR3a (migration-only, this branch) + PR3b (frontend, branch `feat/theme-b-w1b-frontend`)** for safe rollout. **Next = push PR3a + open the migration PR.**)

## Current State

**W1a SHIPPED** — PR1 #522 → `19d99b7`, PR2 #523 → `530b2536` (squash). Full PR1/PR2 detail lives in `…-execution-status-archive.md` (grep, don't read whole).

**Active = PR3 / W1b — SPLIT into two PRs for safe rollout (user verdict 2026-06-20).** The single hottest public RPC → **DATA SAFETY is the top constraint**.
- **PR3a = migration-only** — branch `feat/theme-b-w1b-search-rpc` (off `main` @ `530b2536`): the `20260620000000` migration + the `order_by?: string` types delta + W1b docs. Frontend is UNCHANGED here (still doesn't send `order_by`) → backward-compatible: the new 16-arg RPC's `DEFAULT 'relevance'` serves the old frontend with zero outage window. **This is what pushes/merges first.**
- **PR3b = frontend wiring** — branch `feat/theme-b-w1b-frontend` (currently at `9988bd0`, holds the Task-3.2 commit + everything below it). Ships AFTER PR3a's migration is live + verified on PROD. For PR3b, cut a fresh branch off the post-PR3a `main` and cherry-pick the Task-3.2 frontend changes (avoids the rebase-after-squash friction).

**Why split (deploy-ordering BLOCKER, Codex GATE 3):** `ci.yml` auto-deploys the frontend to PROD on merge (gated only by `test`, no approval), while `migrate-production.yml` holds the migration for MANUAL approval. A combined PR would let the new frontend (sending `order_by`) go live before the migration applied → old 15-arg RPC → PostgREST PGRST202 → **all public search errors** until the migration lands. Split = expand/contract: backward-compatible migration first, frontend after. (Availability risk, not data loss; resolved by splitting.)

**Task 3.1 (migration) DONE + verified — commit `136ba4a`.** All four fixes (C136 sanitizer / `_match_location` helper+GRANT / DROP+CREATE 16-arg `search_lessons` w/ `sort_key`+`sub`-subquery ORDER BY / C11 ghost exclusion both WHEREs). RETURNS unchanged. **Supervisor-verify + GATE 2 both caught real C136 crashes**: per-word strip turned `mother's`→invalid `mother s`; space-only split let a pasted tab survive. SHIPPED fix = strip operators/quotes→spaces BEFORE split + split on `\s+`. Local smoke green; `supabase db reset` clean; `npm run check` green; RLS = 2 pre-existing `archive_duplicate_lesson` failures (proven unrelated). Title-collation LOW resolved by TEST data (`en_US.UTF-8`, 1/745 lowercase-start → plain `title ASC` is intuitive). impl-plan Task 3.1 step 1 + design §4 Q2 corrected to the shipped mechanism.

**Task 3.2 (frontend) DONE + verified — commit `9988bd0` (on `feat/theme-b-w1b-frontend`, NOT on the PR3a branch).** `useLessonSearch` sends `order_by` + adds `sortBy` to queryKey; `SearchPage` threads `viewState.sortBy` + resets page on sort; `IntToolbar` drops the grade option; tests incl. an end-to-end SearchPage→RPC assertion (added per pre-push review). Verified green (1380 tests with it; 1373 without on the migration-only branch).

**NEXT (PR3a):** push `feat/theme-b-w1b-search-rpc` → open the migration PR → **TEST-DB-MCP verify** (ghosts excluded on real corpus; Indoor returns Both; sort `order_by` changes order; no 500 on `herbs & spices`/`mother's`) → bot rounds (GATE 4) → user-gated merge → PROD approval + **3-signal verify** (`reference_ci_flakes.md` first). **THEN PR3b** (frontend) off post-merge main.

**§4 Q1–Q5 LOCKED 2026-06-20** (rationale written inline in design doc §4; W1b flipped to Locked):
- **Q1 C58 sort** [user verdict] = **"Sort minus grade"**: real server-side `order_by` for relevance/title/modified; REMOVE the no-op `grade` option from IntToolbar. `order_by text DEFAULT 'relevance'` → 16-arg → DROP+CREATE. (Sort is a confirmed true no-op today.)
- **Q2 C136** [evidence] = sanitize inside `expand_search_with_synonyms` (per-word regex-strip of tsquery operators `[&|!():*<>]`; trigram fallback preserves recall).
- **Q3 C11** [evidence — TEST+PROD] = exclude 3 exact ghost IDs (`1l9KH63QBe2xhyH0zp6VIavtj0uKSRZtd`, `1lDjv2GUFzOC9pSWTpCVQW2ctWvvNmTPP4Jc1iAzrsaU`, `1nFbpkwlujk8fIO8RkeIcDoO2fuO83Iil2Srf8t5iqm8`; all title="Unknown", all [Indoor]; identical TEST/PROD) in BOTH count+result WHERE + `lesson_id ASC` tiebreaker.
- **Q4 location-Both** [evidence — TEST] = new IMMUTABLE `_match_location` mirroring `_match_cooking_methods`; data is `text[]`, Indoor 456 / Both 203 / Outdoor 107 = 766/766 title-case; expand Indoor→{Indoor,Both}, Outdoor→{Outdoor,Both}, Both→{Both}; replace bare `&&` in both WHEREs.
- **Q5 C84 tags** [user verdict] = **DEFERRED** out of W1b → its own data-quality audit session (tags predate the metadata rebuild). PR1 badge suppression stays; filter still works. Tracked: `project_tags_field_audit_pending` memory + design §9.

**Evidence probes (TEST/PROD, 2026-06-20):** corpus 766; ghosts identical TEST+PROD; location 3 single-element title-case values; tags 74/766; `updated_at` exists (timestamptz); current `search_lessons` = the 15-arg signature (DROP target); EXECUTE grantees = PUBLIC, anon, authenticated, postgres, service_role; `_match_location` confirmed not-yet-existing.

**Tasks authored** (impl plan PR 3): **Task 3.1** = the one migration (C136 sanitizer + `_match_location` helper + DROP/CREATE `search_lessons` w/ `order_by` + C11 exclusion + location swap in both queries; RETURNS unchanged; regenerate types; rollback block; **ORDER BY gotcha**: can't reference the `rank` alias inside a CASE — wrap the result SELECT in a subquery `sub`). **Task 3.2** = client wiring (useLessonSearch `order_by` + queryKey; SearchPage reset page on sort; IntToolbar drop the grade option) + tests.

**Next actions (in order):**
1. ✅ **GATE 1B DONE** (Codex, 2026-06-20, inline) — BLOCKER `_match_location` GRANT + HIGH `service_role` grant + 2 MEDIUM (`sort_key` normalization; quote-strip) folded into Task 3.1.
2. ✅ **Task 3.1 DONE + supervisor-verified** (Session 6) — commit `136ba4a`, local-only. Caught + fixed the C136 mid-word crash (`mother's`).
3. ✅ **GATE 2 DONE** (Codex, Session 6, inline) — 8/9 areas CLEAN; 1 MEDIUM (whitespace split) accepted + fixed (`\s+` split). Ghost-IDs-real + apply-verify flagged UNVERIFIED (ghosts already TEST/PROD-probed Session 5; apply-verify is the standing gate).
4. ✅ **Task 3.2 DONE + supervisor-verified** (Session 6) — commit `9988bd0` (now on `feat/theme-b-w1b-frontend`). Pre-push fix-up: end-to-end SearchPage→RPC test + comment honesty.
5. ✅ **Pre-push gate DONE** (Session 6) — code-reviewer (no BLOCKER/HIGH) + Codex GATE 3 (inline). Codex caught the **deploy-ordering BLOCKER** → resolved by SPLITTING into PR3a/PR3b (user verdict). Test-gap (both models) accepted + fixed. Title-collation LOW resolved by data.
6. **Push PR3a** (`feat/theme-b-w1b-search-rpc`, migration-only) + open the PR. **← NEXT.**
7. **TEST-DB-MCP verify** PR3a on the real corpus (re-verify each DB-affecting round) → bot rounds (GATE 4) → user-gated merge → PROD approval + **3-signal verify** (`reference_ci_flakes.md` first).
8. **THEN PR3b** (frontend) — fresh branch off post-PR3a `main`, cherry-pick the Task-3.2 frontend changes from `feat/theme-b-w1b-frontend`/`9988bd0`; pre-push gate; push; bots; merge. (No new migration; pure-frontend.)

**Branch layout after the split (Session 6):**
- `feat/theme-b-w1b-search-rpc` (PR3a) = `735337d`(docs) → `1bc0198`(docs) → `136ba4a`(migration+types) → `cafd701`(docs) → split-bookkeeping docs commit. **This is the migration PR.** Push this.
- `feat/theme-b-w1b-frontend` (PR3b source) = the above + `9988bd0`(frontend). Holds the Task-3.2 work until PR3a lands on PROD. **Do NOT push this yet.**
- Docs are bundled into PR3a (acceptable — they document the migration). For PR3b, cherry-pick only the frontend changes onto a fresh branch off post-merge main.

## Recent decisions worth carrying forward

- **PR3 SPLIT into PR3a (migration) + PR3b (frontend) — user verdict 2026-06-20 (Session 6).** Codex GATE 3 found a PROD deploy-ordering hazard: the frontend auto-deploys to PROD on merge (no approval) while the migration waits for manual approval, so a combined PR would let the new frontend hit the old RPC → PGRST202 → public-search outage window. Split = expand/contract: ship the backward-compatible migration first (the old frontend works against the new 16-arg RPC via `DEFAULT 'relevance'`), then the frontend after the migration is PROD-live. **General lesson for this repo:** any migration that ADDS a param the frontend will send needs the migration on PROD *before* the frontend deploys — split the PR (or make the client backward-compatible). The combined-PR pattern is unsafe given the auto-frontend-deploy + manual-migration-approval pipeline.
- **C136 sanitizer mechanism corrected during the build (Session 6)** — the LOCKED-plan's "per-word strip after the split" was buggy (mid-word operator/quote → invalid `to_tsquery` token, e.g. `mother's` → `mother s`). Shipped mechanism: strip the operator/quote char class to spaces BEFORE splitting + split on `\s+` (whitespace-robust, GATE-2 add). Caught by supervisor-verify (mid-word) + GATE 2 Codex (tab/newline). Both are correctness fixes *inside* locked decision Q2 ("sanitize inside `expand_search_with_synonyms`") — not product/design changes, so fixed without a user gate. impl-plan §Task-3.1-step-1 + design §4 Q2 updated to match.
- **Supervisor-verify on migrations is load-bearing** (re-confirmed Session 6): re-running the local SQL smoke myself — NOT just reading the diff — caught a real public-search crash the spec'd executor's spec-driven smoke missed (it tested `expand_search_with_synonyms('mother''s')` directly, which returns a string without error; the crash only fires when that string hits `to_tsquery` inside `search_lessons`).
- **GATE 4** (2026-06-20, user-requested): every bot-surfaced *real suggested change* gets a Codex 2nd opinion before finalizing accept/reject. Codex dispatches MUST say "return findings INLINE, do not background" (async-handoff flake; worked first-try ×3 now incl. GATE 2 Session 6).
- **W1b §4 locks** (2026-06-20): see Current State; full rationale in design §4.
- **Tags deferred** (2026-06-20 user verdict): C84 path-a needs a data-quality audit session first — do NOT expose tags in W1b.

## Out-of-scope follow-ups captured here

- **`tags` public badge (C84 path-a)** — deferred to its own audit session (`project_tags_field_audit_pending` memory). The `LessonMetadata.tags` type gap (`database.types.ts:256` has `tags`; `src/types/index.ts` `LessonMetadata` does not) is part of THAT future work, not W1b.
- **`filter_lesson_format` dead RPC param** — kept in the W1b signature (harmless); dropping it = the separate deferred Task 1.3a (also needs the frontend to stop sending it). Bundle into a future RPC change, NOT W1b.
- **C14 IntPillGroup ARIA-forwarding** (from PR2) — pill-group controls only get wrapper-level `id`/`aria-label`; flagged follow-up.
- **LessonSearchPicker stale state after select→clear (R2-4, from PR2)** — REAL but pre-existing; fix later with a reset on `selected→null` + a test.
- **ArrowUp APG return-to-input (R2-2, from PR2)** — current clamp-at-0 is LOCKED design §5; only change with user sign-off (a design change, not a bug).

## Session log

### Session 6 — 2026-06-20 — Task 3.1 migration + Task 3.2 frontend built + verified + pre-push-gated; PR3 split for safe rollout

Supervisor session. Built + verified both W1b tasks, ran the pre-push gate, and split PR3 into a migration-first PR3a + a follow-up frontend PR3b per a Codex-caught deploy-ordering hazard (user verdict). Stopped before pushing PR3a.

- Oriented; git matched the status file; baseline `npm run check` clean. Untracked `docs/plans/*` are unrelated other-initiative kickoffs (left alone).
- **Dispatched Task 3.1 executor** (Opus, fresh context, `database-migrations` + `/new-migration` + TDD skills, local-first, no push). It built `20260620000000_search_lessons_w1b.sql` faithfully per spec (all four fixes; `sub`-subquery ORDER BY; both-WHERE deltas; GRANTs incl. `_match_location` + `service_role`; RETURNS unchanged) + the 1-line types delta; committed locally.
- **Types regen note (from executor):** local Supabase CLI is **v2.95.4**, older than whatever generated the committed `database.types.ts` (which carries a `PostgrestVersion: '13.0.5'` pin a full regen would strip). Executor applied ONLY the true schema delta (`order_by?: string`) to preserve format. Verified it matches a temp full-regen modulo formatting. **Follow-up:** consider regenerating with a newer CLI before merge (optional — current delta is correct).
- **Supervisor-verify (load-bearing):** read the full SQL; diffed the body against `20260520020000` (faithful copy + only intended deltas); re-ran the local MCP smoke myself. **Caught a real crash:** `search_lessons('mother''s')` → `syntax error in tsquery: "mother s"`. Root cause: the spec's per-word strip leaves a mid-word operator/quote as an internal space. **Fixed** (strip-before-split), re-applied (`supabase db reset`), re-verified, amended the commit.
- **GATE 2 (Codex on the SQL, inline — no async flake):** 8/9 areas CLEAN (DROP/CREATE sig, GRANTs, C11 both-WHERE parity, quoting, ORDER BY subquery, `_match_location` semantics, rollback). **1 MEDIUM:** space-only split lets a pasted tab/newline survive → `to_tsquery` error. Rebuttal-passed (real, crash-class, public surface) → **accepted + fixed** (`regexp_split_to_array(…, '\s+')`); confirmed `E'herbs\tspices'` crashed pre-fix, clean post-fix. Re-applied + re-verified; amended the commit → **`136ba4a`**.
- **Final smoke (all green, no crash):** operators `& | ( ) : *`, mid-word quotes (`mother's`, `herbs&spices`), `a:b`, tab/newline/CR, empty/NULL (→5 match-all); title≠modified order; deterministic empty-query order; NULL/grade→relevance; `_match_location` truth table (Indoor⊇Both, Both-only, Outdoor∌Both); ghost clause executes; signature = 16-arg; grants = anon/authenticated/service_role(+postgres owner). `npm run check` green.
- **Dispatched Task 3.2 executor** (Opus, fresh context, TDD): client wiring — `useLessonSearch` `order_by`+queryKey, `SearchPage` thread+page-reset, `IntToolbar` drop grade option, tests. Committed `659facc` → 1380 tests green.
- **Supervisor-verify Task 3.2:** read the diff (correct per spec), re-ran `npm run check` + the 3 touched test files (38 pass, non-vacuous). Confirmed the stale-`grade`-in-select edge is UNREACHABLE — `searchStore` `partialize` persists only `view`/`density`, never `sortBy`, so `sortBy` resets to `relevance` each load and the toolbar can only set the 3 valid values.
- **Pre-push gate (code-reviewer + Codex GATE 3, parallel):**
  - code-reviewer: no BLOCKER/HIGH; verified C136 fix, ghost-parity, GRANTs, `sub` ORDER BY empirically. MEDIUM = the `currentPage:1` write is functionally inert (nothing reads `viewState.currentPage`; real reset is the queryKey) + the comment/test overstate it. LOW = title collation might not be A–Z.
  - Codex GATE 3 (inline): SQL/caching/page-reset CLEAN. **BLOCKER = deploy-ordering** (combined frontend+migration unsafe — frontend auto-deploys before manual-approval migration). LOW = no end-to-end SearchPage→RPC test.
  - **Triage:** title-collation resolved by TEST data (`en_US.UTF-8`, 1/745 lowercase-start → plain `title ASC` intuitive — no migration change). Test-gap (both models agreed) → added an end-to-end SearchPage→RPC assertion + softened the `currentPage` comment; kept the write (spec'd/convention). Amended frontend → `9988bd0`. Deploy-ordering BLOCKER → **user verdict: SPLIT** (see recent-decisions).
- **Split executed:** preserved the frontend commit on `feat/theme-b-w1b-frontend` (`9988bd0`); `git reset --hard cafd701` on the migration branch (drops the frontend commit). Migration branch (PR3a) re-verified green (`npm run check`; full suite 1373) with the frontend back at its pre-3.2 (backward-compatible) state. Updated this status file + design §7 / impl PR3 header for the split.

Learnings:
- **Catch deploy-ordering hazards before merge, not after.** An additive RPC param + a frontend that sends it, in one PR, is unsafe here: the frontend auto-deploys to PROD on merge while the migration waits for manual approval → outage window. Codex (different model family) caught what the in-loop review didn't frame as a rollout risk. Expand/contract (migration-first) is the fix.
- **Re-run the migration's behavioral smoke in the MAIN LOOP, not just read the diff** — the executor's spec-driven smoke tested the sanitizer function in isolation (returns a string, no error) and missed that the string is invalid only once `to_tsquery` consumes it inside `search_lessons`. The end-to-end `search_lessons('mother''s')` probe is what caught it.
- **A LOCKED mechanism can still be wrong.** Q2's locked decision (sanitize inside `expand_search_with_synonyms`) was right; its *literal code sketch* (per-word strip) was buggy. Correctness fixes inside a locked decision don't need a user gate; product/design changes do. Update the plan docs to match what shipped.
- **Codex "return findings INLINE" worked first-try a 4th time** (GATE 2). Reliable.

### Session 5 — 2026-06-20 — PR3/W1b cycle opened: §4 locked, Task 3.1/3.2 authored + GATE-1B-hardened

Supervisor session. No code on the branch yet — this session was the full W1b design-lock + task-authoring + plan-review phase. Clean handoff at the end.

- Oriented; git matched the status file; baseline `npm run check` clean. Worktree had pre-existing untracked `docs/plans/*` (unrelated — left alone).
- **User decisions:** Q1 = "Sort minus grade" (real `order_by` for relevance/title/modified, drop the grade option); Q5 = **defer tags** to its own audit session (tags predate the metadata rebuild — needs vocab reconciliation before public exposure).
- Captured the **tags-audit-pending** concern as a durable project memory (`project_tags_field_audit_pending`) + MEMORY.md index line (user: "don't lose track").
- **§4 evidence gathering:** background Explore agent code digest (current RPC body @ `20260520020000`, sort wiring, C136 sanitizer site, `_match_cooking_methods` helper, tags chain, migration ordering) + TEST/PROD MCP probes (ghosts identical TEST/PROD all title="Unknown"/[Indoor]; location 766/766 single-element title-case; tags 74/766; `updated_at` exists; current 15-arg sig; grantees incl. service_role).
- **Locked §4 Q1–Q5** inline in design doc + updated status line / §6 / §7 table / §9; flipped W1b → Locked.
- **Authored Task 3.1 (migration) + Task 3.2 (client wiring)** in the impl plan (skeleton → concrete).
- **PR-cycle archival:** moved PR2 (Sessions 3/4 + round outcomes + Done detail + decisions) into the archive; slimmed this file to the PR3 cycle.
- **GATE 1B** (Codex, returned **inline** — no async flake): **1 BLOCKER** (missing `_match_location` GRANT — invoker-rights RPC), **1 HIGH** (`service_role` missing from the `search_lessons` GRANT vs the `20260514` precedent), **3 MEDIUM** (explicit-`NULL order_by` wouldn't fall back to relevance → add a normalized `sort_key`; sanitizer apostrophe/quote handling left ambiguous → make quote-strip explicit; DROP+CREATE atomicity), **9 LOW**. Rebuttal-passed all → accepted + folded BLOCKER/HIGH/2-MEDIUM into Task 3.1; documented atomicity (precedent + Supabase per-file transaction wrapping → no missing-function window; CREATE-OR-REPLACE impossible since sig changes); confirmed the 9 LOW are already in the plan or impl-time checks.
- **Handoff:** stopped at this clean boundary rather than start the migration build on a heavy context — DATA SAFETY on the hottest public RPC warrants a fresh budget for executor + supervisor-verify + GATE 2.

Learnings:
- **GATE 1B (reviewing the authored PLAN before any code) is load-bearing for migrations** — it caught a runtime BLOCKER (helper GRANT) + a HIGH grant gap that would otherwise surface only at TEST/PROD apply, plus a real NULL-fallback hole. Run a plan-review gate before dispatching migration executors, not just a post-code gate.
- **Codex "return findings INLINE, do not background" worked first-try a 3rd consecutive time** (PR2 ×2 + this) — promote to a feedback memory (the async-handoff flake is reliably avoided by the explicit instruction).
