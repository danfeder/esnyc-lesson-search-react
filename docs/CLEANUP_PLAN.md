# ESYNYC Lesson Search v2 - Codebase Cleanup Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive cleanup and improvement plan for the ESYNYC Lesson Search v2 codebase. The plan is organized into 7 sections, each with its own feature branch, all merging into a main cleanup branch before final integration.

## Branching Strategy

```
main
└── cleanup/main (parent cleanup branch)
    ├── cleanup/remove-unnecessary-files
    ├── cleanup/documentation-updates
    ├── cleanup/code-quality
    ├── cleanup/archive-management
    ├── cleanup/feature-completion
    ├── cleanup/project-structure
    └── cleanup/security-performance
```

### Branch Flow:
1. Create `cleanup/main` from `main`
2. Create each `cleanup/*` branch from `cleanup/main`
3. Complete work in each branch
4. Merge each branch back to `cleanup/main` via PR
5. Final review and merge `cleanup/main` to `main`
